#Simone

This is the frontend application which talks to
[Beauvoir](https://github.com/LucyParsonsCenter/Beauvoir).

React + Flux + React router + es6 and so on.

##Development

Want to do some development work? Great! Clone the repo and do:

```
npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server
cd ./Simone && npm install
```

We're using Webpack for transpilation of ES2015 to ES5, JSX to plain JS,
and compiling Sass to plain CSS. To start up the hot-reloading webpack dev
server just do:

```
npm start
```

after you've installed everything, and the hot-reload server should come
up! Check `http://localhost:8080`.
